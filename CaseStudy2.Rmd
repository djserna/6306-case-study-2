## Job Analysis

1. Do certain technology job roles line up with specific mental health diagnoses?

Our team was interested in determining if there is a correlation between mental health diagnoses and technology job roles. For exammple, is there a higher prevelance of anxiety disorder attributed to back-end developers? If we can find a correlation, perhaps we can better target treatment based on a person's job role.

By analyzing the data, we do not find any significant correlation between job role and mental health diagnoses. We will need to determine other avenues for targeting treatment.

```{r jobRoleAnalysis}
#Create a subset data frame to hold diagnoses and job role data.
MHPosition <- data.frame(CurrentDiagnoses = MHSubset$MHCurrentlyDiagnosed, CurrentPosition = MHSubset$CurrentPosition)

#break up the pipe delimitted values into rows.
MHPositionSplit <- explodeDataFrameColumn(MHPosition, "CurrentDiagnoses")
MHPositionSplit <- explodeDataFrameColumn(MHPositionSplit, "CurrentPosition")

#create lookup tables so we can run correlation analysis
diagnoses <- data.frame(Diagnosis = unique(MHPositionSplit$CurrentDiagnoses), DiagnosisCode = 1:length(unique(MHPositionSplit$CurrentDiagnoses)))
positions <- data.frame(Position = unique(MHPositionSplit$CurrentPosition), PositionCode = 1:length(unique(MHPositionSplit$CurrentPosition)))

#rename columns so we can use merge function.
colnames(MHPositionSplit) <- c("Diagnosis", "Position")

MHPositionSplitCoded <- merge(MHPositionSplit, diagnoses, by = "Diagnosis")
MHPositionSplitCoded <- merge(MHPositionSplitCoded, positions, by = "Position")
plot(MHPositionSplitCoded$DiagnosisCode, MHPositionSplitCoded$PositionCode)
#correlation value
cor(MHPositionSplitCoded$DiagnosisCode, MHPositionSplitCoded$PositionCode)
```
<!-- 2. Is there a correlation between remote work and mental health diagnosis? -->

<!-- ```{r remoteWorkAnalysis} -->
<!-- RemoteWorkAnalysis <- data.frame(WorkRemotely = MHSubsetAnalysis$NUM_WorkRemotely, CurrentlyDiagnosed = MHSubsetAnalysis$NUM_MHCurrently) -->
<!-- RemoteWorkAnalysis <- RemoteWorkAnalysis[!(RemoteWorkAnalysis$WorkRemotely == 2 | RemoteWorkAnalysis$CurrentlyDiagnosed == 2),] -->
<!-- plot(RemoteWorkAnalysis$WorkRemotely, RemoteWorkAnalysis$CurrentlyDiagnosed) -->
<!-- cor(RemoteWorkAnalysis$WorkRemotely, RemoteWorkAnalysis$CurrentlyDiagnosed) -->
<!-- ``` -->

## State Analysis

1.   Is mental healthcare coverage higher in certain states?

The team subsetted the data to only rows that had state names and for rows that had identified if the company provided mental health coverage.  From this inital exclusion of data the data was subsetted from 1,433 rows of data to 515 rows of data which constituents 36% of useable data.

From the limited data set we can see that most companies offer mental health insurance, when normalizing the data to the per 1000 square miles of each state we see that Rhode Island, Massachusetts, and Maryland have thie highest coverage of mental health insurance.  This coincides when charting the coverage by region, which shows Northeast part of the US having the highest coverage.

Though the analysis shows the Northeast having the most insured individuals with mental health coverage, the results should be used cautiously as the bulk of the observations are unuseable due to a lack of response.

## Remote Working Analysis

1.   Are there higher reports of mental health issues for remote workers?

The team subsetted the data to include the columns of 'WorkRemotely' and 'NUM_MHCurrently'.  These two columns are used to indicate if the observation has a mental health issue or not.  The team provided multiple ways to cross check the results to ensure that the results were verified.

A table is produced that aggregates the groups by the categorical variable 'WorkRemotely'
    a.   Always
    b.   Never
    c.   Sometimes

The binary responses of 'NUM_MHCurrently' are:
    a.   No = 0
    b.   Yes = 1

A proportion table is provided that shows the percentages of recieving a mental health issue by category.  From first look it seems that there is no significant chance of recieving a mental health issue from any of the categorical variables.  To test and confirm this hyptohesis the team decided to do a chi square test, a regression test, and a simple ANOVA test.  For each of these the test the Pvalue is greater than alpha of 0.05 indicating that there is no significant chance of recieving a mental health issue from working working at home, working at the office and at home, or working in the office full time.

From the data set provided the team concluded that there is no significant chance of being diagonsed with a mental health issue from individuals that work at the office, home, or both.

## Substance Abuse Analysis

1. Do workes with substance abuse disorder feel more or less willing to discuss their issue with their supervisor when compared to other disorders?

The team subsetted the data to include the columns of 'HasSubstanceAbuse' and 'NUM_DiscussMHWithBoss'.  The NUM_DiscussMHWithBoss column is used to indicate if the observation is willing to discuss their mental health issue with their direct supervisor. The HasSubstanceAbuse column indicates if the observation's mental health issue relates to substance abuse.  The team provided multiple ways to cross check the results to ensure that the results were verified.

A table is produced that aggregates the groups by the binary variable 'HasSubstanceAbuse'

The binary responses of 'NUM_DiscussMHWithBoss' are:

No = 0

Yes = 1

A proportion table is provided that shows the percentages of workers with mental health issues that would discuss the issue with their direct supervisor. It appears that workers with a substance abuse disorder are more likely to discuss the situation with their boss when compared to workers with other mental health issues. 59.1% of workers with a substance abuse problem would discuss the issue with their supervisor compared to 53.8% of workers with other mental health issues. 

```{r substanceAbuseSupervisor}
#Get a subset of workers with mental health issues for analysis
MHSubstanceAbuseSupervisor <- sqldf("SELECT 
                    NUM_DiscussMHWithBoss
                    ,HasSubstanceAbuse
                    FROM MHSubsetAnalysis
                    WHERE NUM_DiscussMHWithBoss <> 2
                    AND NUM_MHCurrently=1")

#Number obs in each category
table(HasSubstanceAbuse=MHSubstanceAbuseSupervisor$HasSubstanceAbuse, DiscussWithBoss=MHSubstanceAbuseSupervisor$NUM_DiscussMHWithBoss)

#Proportion of those with substance abuset that would discuss the issue with their supervisor
prop.table(table(HasSubstanceAbuse=MHSubstanceAbuseSupervisor$HasSubstanceAbuse, DiscussWithBoss=MHSubstanceAbuseSupervisor$NUM_DiscussMHWithBoss), margin = 1)*100

#Chi square test of association
chisq.test(table(HasSubstanceAbuse=MHSubstanceAbuseSupervisor$HasSubstanceAbuse, DiscussWithBoss=MHSubstanceAbuseSupervisor$NUM_DiscussMHWithBoss))

fitSA <- glm(NUM_DiscussMHWithBoss ~ HasSubstanceAbuse, data=MHSubstanceAbuseSupervisor, family = binomial )
summary(fitSA)
```


2. Do workers with substance abuse disorders report that their anonymity was more or less protected when compmared to other mental health issues?

The team subsetted the data to include the columns of 'HasSubstanceAbuse' and 'NUM_AnonymityProtected'.  The NUM_AnonymityProtected column is used to indicate if the observation reports their anonymity was protected after divulging their mental health issue. The HasSubstanceAbuse column indicates if the observation's mental health issue relates to substance abuse.  The team provided multiple ways to cross check the results to ensure that the results were verified.

A table is produced that aggregates the groups by the binary variable 'HasSubstanceAbuse'

The binary responses of 'NUM_AnonymityProtected' are:

No = 0

Yes = 1

A proportion table is provided that shows the percentages of workers with mental health issues that believe their anonymity was protected after divulging a mental health issue. It appears that workers with a substance abuse disorder are less likely to report their anonymity was protected when compared to other mental health issues. 72.22% of workers with substance abuse disorder report their anonymity was protected compared to 83.97% of workers with other mental health issues. It is encouraging to see that workers with both substance abuse disorders and other mental health issues report a high degree of anonymity.

```{r substanceAbuseAnonymity}
#Get a subset of workers with mental health issues for analysis
MHSubstanceAbuseAnonymity <- sqldf("SELECT 
                    NUM_AnonymityProtected
                    ,HasSubstanceAbuse
                    FROM MHSubsetAnalysis
                    WHERE NUM_AnonymityProtected <> 2
                    AND NUM_MHCurrently=1")

#Number obs in each category
table(HasSubstanceAbuse=MHSubstanceAbuseAnonymity$HasSubstanceAbuse, AnonymityProtected=MHSubstanceAbuseAnonymity$NUM_AnonymityProtected)

#Proportion of those with substance abuset that would discuss the issue with their supervisor
prop.table(table(HasSubstanceAbuse=MHSubstanceAbuseAnonymity$HasSubstanceAbuse, AnonymityProtected=MHSubstanceAbuseAnonymity$NUM_AnonymityProtected), margin = 1)*100

#Chi square test of association
chisq.test(table(HasSubstanceAbuse=MHSubstanceAbuseAnonymity$HasSubstanceAbuse, AnonymityProtected=MHSubstanceAbuseAnonymity$NUM_AnonymityProtected))

fitSAA <- glm(NUM_AnonymityProtected ~ HasSubstanceAbuse, data=MHSubstanceAbuseAnonymity, family = binomial )
summary(fitSAA)
```

3. Do workers with substance abuse disorder report that they have experience with unsuportive response when compared to other mental health issues?

The team subsetted the data to include the columns of 'HasSubstanceAbuse' and 'NUM_NegResponseWithMH'.  The NUM_NegResponseWithMH column is used to indicate if the observation reports observing or experiencing an unsuportive repsonse with mental health issues in the workplace. The HasSubstanceAbuse column indicates if the observation's mental health issue relates to substance abuse.  The team provided multiple ways to cross check the results to ensure that the results were verified.

A table is produced that aggregates the groups by the binary variable 'HasSubstanceAbuse'

The binary responses of 'NUM_NegResponseWithMH' are:

No = 0

Yes = 1

A proportion table is provided that shows the percentages of workers with mental health issues that report observing or experiencing an unsuportive response to a mental health issue. It appears that workers with a substance abuse disorder are more likely to observe or experience an unsuportive reponse when compared to other mental health issues. 71.43% of workers with substance abuse disorder report an unsuportive response compared to 54.99% of workers with other mental health issues. It is disturbing to see such a high report of unsuportive responses for workers with substance abuse disorders.

```{r substanceAbuseNegResponse}
#Get a subset of workers with mental health issues for analysis
MHSubstanceAbuseNegResponse <- sqldf("SELECT 
                    NUM_NegResponseWithMH
                    ,HasSubstanceAbuse
                    FROM MHSubsetAnalysis
                    WHERE NUM_NegResponseWithMH <> 2
                    AND NUM_MHCurrently=1")

#Number obs in each category
table(HasSubstanceAbuse=MHSubstanceAbuseNegResponse$HasSubstanceAbuse, NegResponse=MHSubstanceAbuseNegResponse$NUM_NegResponseWithMH)

#Proportion of those with substance abuset that would discuss the issue with their supervisor
prop.table(table(HasSubstanceAbuse=MHSubstanceAbuseNegResponse$HasSubstanceAbuse, NegResponse=MHSubstanceAbuseNegResponse$NUM_NegResponseWithMH), margin = 1)*100

#Chi square test of association
chisq.test(table(HasSubstanceAbuse=MHSubstanceAbuseNegResponse$HasSubstanceAbuse, NegResponse=MHSubstanceAbuseNegResponse$NUM_NegResponseWithMH))

fitSAR <- glm(NUM_NegResponseWithMH ~ HasSubstanceAbuse, data=MHSubstanceAbuseNegResponse, family = binomial )
summary(fitSAR)
```

4. Do workers with substance abuse disorder report that they hear of negative consequences for co-workers with mental health issues?
